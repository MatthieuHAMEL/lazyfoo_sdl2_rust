# lazyfoo_sdl2_rust

Work in progress as of october, 2024 !

This is my Rust port of [Lazyfoo's famous SDL2 tutorials](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php)

My aim is to respect the spirit of the tutorials and the SDL2 API as much as possible, while complying with the important software principles - most of them are imposed by Rust - in terms of **safety** and **design** : encapsulation, clever error propagation, careful ownership considerations, no global variables...

... and, because I don't want to be translating C code foolishly, **using the best of Rust features** : pattern matching, functional programming patterns, advanced data structures, Unicode support, testing functionalities, ...
