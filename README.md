# lazyfoo_sdl2_rust
My own Rust port of [Lazyfoo's famous SDL2 tutorials](https://lazyfoo.net/tutorials/SDL/index.php)

My aim is to respect the spirit of the tutorials and the SDL2 API as much as possible, while complying with the Rust principles in terms of safety and design (encapsulation, clever error propagation, no global variables...)
